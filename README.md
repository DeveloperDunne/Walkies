### *Navigation*

- At the top of the page you can see the webistes name 'Walkies' and a navigation bar, this clearly tells the user the name of the website and links to other parts of the page.
- When clicked on the 'About Us', 'Services' and 'Sign Up' links each will take you to these different sections of the page.
- The Navigation bar is fixed and will follow down the page so that it is always available.
- When used on mobiles the navigation bar condenses into a burger icon.

### *Sign Up*

- In this section users can sign up for one of the services described and for further details.

- The form has been designed so that the user cannot submit without providing certin details. It collects the owners data and some of that of the dog.

- The sign up section is valuable as it gives the user the opportunity to show that they are interested in the services.

# Testing

- I tested this pages and it worked on Chrome and Safari.

- I tested that the page looked good, all functions worked and was responsive on all standard screen sizes using the devtools toolbar.

- I tested that all navigation links took you to the relevant parts of the page and that social links opened in new tabs.

- I can confirm that the form works and will not allow submission until all relevant information has been submitted.

- I also had other people test the site to ensure I had not missed anything.

## Bugs

### *Solved bugs*

- Before deploying and upon testing I realised that my checkboxes were not working correctly, this is because I had enabled the 'required' action on all of them and so I fixed this so that you only check the ones you require.

- Removing the 'required' action fixed this problem.

### *Unsolved bugs*

- The header when testing responsiveness sometimes overlays to the right, I would hvae liked to resolve this however ran out of time.

# Validator Testing

### *HTML*

- No errors were displayed when putting the code through the official W3C Validator.
