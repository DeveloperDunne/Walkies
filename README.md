# Testing

- I tested this pages and it worked on Chrome and Safari.

- I tested that the page looked good, all functions worked and was responsive on all standard screen sizes using the devtools toolbar.

- I tested that all navigation links took you to the relevant parts of the page and that social links opened in new tabs.

- I can confirm that the form works and will not allow submission until all relevant information has been submitted.

- I also had other people test the site to ensure I had not missed anything.

## Bugs

### *Solved bugs*

- Before deploying and upon testing I realised that my checkboxes were not working correctly, this is because I had enabled the 'checked' action and so I fixed this so that you only check the ones you require.

- Removing the 'Checked' action fixed this problem.

### *Unsolved bugs*

- I would have liked to change the checkboxes when ticked from blue to green to make the website color pallete however could not find how to solve this.
